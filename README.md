Currency Converter with Tkinter
This project is a simple currency converter built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for converting currency values using up-to-date exchange rates from an API. The program is divided into two main tabs: "Currencies" and "Convert."

Features
Currencies Tab: In this tab, users can specify their home currency, the currency they want to convert to, and the current conversion rate. The "Lock" button validates and locks the inputs, enabling the second tab for conversion.
Convert Tab: This tab allows users to enter an amount in the "Amount to convert" field. Clicking the "Convert" button calculates and displays the converted currency value in the "Converted currency" field. A "Clear" button is also provided to reset the inputs.
How to Use
Open the application.
Navigate between the "Currencies" and "Convert" tabs using the tabs at the top.
In the "Currencies" tab, enter your home currency, conversion currency, and conversion rate. Click "Lock" to proceed.
In the "Convert" tab, enter the amount you want to convert. Click "Convert" to see the converted value. Use the "Clear" button to reset inputs.
